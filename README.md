## 🔐 Authentication

* Registration and login with JWT token generation
* Tokens are stored in `localStorage`
* User identity is auto-fetched via `/auth/me`

---

## 📊 Analytics

* Charts built with `Recharts`
* Example: Contribution per week
* Can be extended to pull real-time metrics

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Soft delete with archival trace logs
* Role-based access (admin vs user)
* Pagination and search for artifacts
* Dark mode UI support
